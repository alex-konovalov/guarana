- Since we do lots of computation with elements in CN it migh be useful 
  to represent them in the form [ c, log(n) ].
  This way, the tail in C\cap N has only to be computed when we
  switch back to the group represenetation. 
  Computations in C would be done via Deep Thought.
- Maybe it might be useful to use the trick of Exp of Star prdouct.
