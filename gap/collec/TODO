- convert remaining parts from collec.gi 
  ( create MalcevGElement,
  ( conjugation with finite elm, 

-  Computations in C could be done via Deep Thought.
- Maybe it might be useful to use the trick of Exp of Star prdouct.

- catch all the trivial cases ( F trivial, C trivial, N trivial )
  speed up the computation when a part of the input is trivial.
  (F part, C part, N part and combinations and so on )

- create a Malcev collector, 
  How can I attache this collector to a pcp group ?
