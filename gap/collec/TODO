- convert remaining parts from collec.gi 
  ( create MalcevGElement,
  ( conjugation with finite elm, 

-  Computations in C could be done via Deep Thought.
- Maybe it might be useful to use the trick of Exp of Star prdouct.

- catch all the trivial cases ( F trivial, C trivial, N trivial )
  speed up the computation when a part of the input is trivial.
  (F part, C part, N part and combinations and so on )

- create a Malcev collector, 
  How can I attache this collector to a pcp group ? 

- The function GUARANA.MO_G_CN_AddMultTable takes a bit of 
  time. (for Tr_8_O1 6 seconds). We could probably speed 
  this up. In the moment most time is needed for 
  GrpElmByExpsAndCollNC. 
  Also the function GUARANA.G_CN_NumberToExpVector seems to 
  be not very efficient. 

  Furhter it seems that the whole setup has still the potential 
  to be speeded up. 

- F_36 semdirect Aut1 
  shows a very strange behaviour. 
  The function Add_G_LieAuts needs 20 seconds which 
  is roughly a half of the whole setup. 
  Further it seems that using symbolic Log slows down the
  same function immensly !!
