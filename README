                             The Example package

This is the README file for the GAP package "Example".

This package serves as an example of how to create a  GAP  4  package.
This release (2.0) has  been  updated  for  the  new  package  loading
mechanism introduced in GAP 4.4. Some indications of what changes were
necessary will be found in comments.

The  package is  distributed with  the main  GAP archive.  For updates
between releases of GAP itself check the package Web page
     http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Greg.Gamble/Example
  
or the Australian mirrors

http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~gregg/Example/      (Perth, Australia)
http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~gregg/Example/        (Queensland, Australia)

or via the Packages links from the GAP sites

http://www.gap-system.org/                       (UK)
http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~GAP/             (Germany)

or the GAP ftp servers

ftp://ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/zoo/packages/
ftp://ftp.math.rwth-aachen.de/pub/gap4/zoo/packages/

If you prefer tar.gz or tar.bz2 to zoo archives, substitute tar.gz  or
tar.bz2 (as appropriate) for zoo in the above paths.

The Example package uses an external binary and therefore  a  complete
installation only works on UNIX systems  or  systems  that  support  a
UNIX-like environment, e.g. Macintosh OSX,  or  Windows  with  Cygwin.
However,  a  partial  installation  without  the  external  binary  is
possible on any system.

     Installing  a complete Example package (with external binary)

To  complete the  installation of  the ``Example''  package go  to the
directory `example'  created (the  directory contains  a copy  of this
README file) and call

  /bin/sh ./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory; so normally you
would call

  /bin/sh ./configure ../..

(the ../.. is the default and so may be omitted) and then call

  make 
  
to compile the binary.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you  must  execute  the
configure/make steps for  the  ``Example''  package  on  each  of  the
architectures  immediately  after  configuring  GAP  itself  on   this
architecture.

That's it. Now start GAP and type

  LoadPackage("example");

The ``Example" package banner should appear on the screen. If you have
not compiled the external binary, you  should  receive  a  warning  of
this.

For details on  how  to  use  the  Example  package  see  the  package
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (view either `manual.dvi'  via
`xdvi' or or `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer). You will find  additional
information on how to create a GAP package  in  the  Appendix  of  the
manual.
