Concrete TODO:

- clean up package 
  - which code should not be contained ?
    
  - this should be remove with the packing script
    remove: gap/supple/*
            tst/completeOldCode
            tst/repsWerner


- how do we set malcev collection as underlying collector ? 

- write Readme


- bring package on website:
  1. test with normal gap
  2. finish packaging script.





- Run group computations with Malcev collector. 

- clean up code in gap/supple

- integrate code from symbolic.g
  How can we speed up the computation of the star polynomials ? 

- investigate why the computation of the log,exp polynomials
  is so  fast, once we have the star polys. 
  For example in F_2,8 using the symbolic Lie bracket is very slow. 
  But it seems that using the star pols for computing log and exp
  does not take much more time.


- Long term aim:
  The user comes along with a pc-group G.
 
  In a first step a good polycyclic sequence of G is computed. 
  Second the Mal'cev correspondence is set up and everything else
  that is needed for the fast multiplication. 
  Then collection can be performed using this setup. 

  It seems reasonable to have a record like 
  recLieAlg 
  that contains everything that is needed to go back
  and forwards between N and L(N). 

  Probably it is not so good to attach information to N,
  because N might change or at least the pcp presentation 
  of it.
