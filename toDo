To do:

- Finish off the integration of the bch.g code. 
  Give some examples for the usage in the file.
  - finish conversion of exmas/tgrps.gi
  - finish conversion gap/setup.gi 

- Long term aim:
  The user comes along with a pc-group G.
 
  In a first step a good polycyclic sequence of G is computed. 
  Second the Mal'cev correspondence is set up and everything else
  that is needed for the fast multiplication. 
  Then collection can be performed using this setup. 

  It seems reasonable to have a record like 
  recLieAlg 
  that contains everything that is needed to go back
  and forwards between N and L(N). 

  Probably it is not so good to attach information to N,
  because N might change or at least the pcp presentation 
  of it.
