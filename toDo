To do:

- integrate code from symbolic.g
  How can we speed up the computation of the star polynomials ? 
  
- Go step for step through the paper and implement everything
  that is mentionend. For example:
  - application of powers of automorph.
  - application of recursive powers of autom.
- Write code to compute the weights of a collector. 
  Compare with Werner's code in polycyclic ( IsWeightedCollector ). 

- Long term aim:
  The user comes along with a pc-group G.
 
  In a first step a good polycyclic sequence of G is computed. 
  Second the Mal'cev correspondence is set up and everything else
  that is needed for the fast multiplication. 
  Then collection can be performed using this setup. 

  It seems reasonable to have a record like 
  recLieAlg 
  that contains everything that is needed to go back
  and forwards between N and L(N). 

  Probably it is not so good to attach information to N,
  because N might change or at least the pcp presentation 
  of it.
